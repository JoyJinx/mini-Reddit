# mini-Reddit

<br />
This mini project of mine is actually my first somewhat big app made, using Node, Express, EJS, Bootstrap and more.
<br />
This is basically a blogging web app which supports posts with images and also likablity function and comment section.
<br />
For templating I used EJS with the use of Bootstrap for fast and simple UI design.
